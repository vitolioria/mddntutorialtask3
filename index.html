							<h2>Dithering images</h2>
							<p>For this website, I implemented different images that have been dithered. By using dithered images, it allows the page size to be reduced which results in less resources being used to load the website. It helps to make websites load fast as well while also allowing for images to be used.</p>

								<p>
							The images used are images obtained from my tutorial one task which has gone through colour to now black and white. Although the dithering process makes the image more 'pixelated' we are still able to see what the images are.  </p>

							<h3>Defult typeface - No logo</h3>
							<p> Rather than create a logo, I had simply used an H1 variable to use as the title of the website. This not only lets visitors know what the website is for but also acts as the supposed website logo. Thus leading to the contribution of less power/energy consumption being used.  </p>

					<h2>Importance for the future</h2>
					<h4>Using low carbon web design practices is important as it helps aid the decrease in energy consumption.</br> The internet produces around 3.8% of global emmissions (Source: Sustainable Web Design: The Ultimate Guide). </br>Although a small amount now, we must understand that we are on track towards a massive increase which can ultimately affect future environmental issues (already a massive problem).</br>  Not only that, but it can enhance ones user experience on websites. With the growth of 'fast paced' culture, web users are willing and would be wanting to use websites that take less time to load.</br> Not only that, but the web design practices allow for more simple yet clean and aesthetically pleasing experiences. This can also drive up business visits and usage up.  </h4>
